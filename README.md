Concept:
I'm looking to get a heart, with roses and jasmine flowers around it, and a scroll across the heart that says "therapy". Black & grey.

---
I like the font used on this scroll - sans serif, no frills:

---
I prefer the plainer scroll on the right than the one on the left, which has a serif font and some shading where the word is. But I prefer the more compact shape of the one on the left:

---
I like how realistic the flowers are in these two:

This robin piece is gorgeous, I love the hollow heart. But I'm happy to go with whatever style heart you think works best:

Finally here're some photos of the jasmine in my garden. Technically it's star jasmine (Trachelospermum jasminoides) rather than jasmine proper.
